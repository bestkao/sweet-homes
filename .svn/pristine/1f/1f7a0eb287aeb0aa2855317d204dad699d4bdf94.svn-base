                        Sweet Homes is a web accessible online real estate service 
                        for the San Francisco Bay Area that Group Zero One is 
                        developing for Petkovic Sosnick Enterprises. Our site shall 
                        be accessible from Google Chrome web browsers and mobile devices.
                        Our users can search through properties without page navigation.
                        Our simplified navigation allows the homebuyer focus on finding 
                        the right fit for them rather than learning how to navigate the
                        site. We seek to offer property investors a detailed view into the 
                        properties that interest them. You do not even have to register 
                        to look at properties.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph2">Have you searched through all the properties
                        and are still not able to find the one that you are looking for?
                        For registered members we provide them with the service of getting 
                        a notification of properties that contain the search criteria of
                        properties they are fascinated with. Once you become a member
                        you can even contact any realtor to sell your property. Our realtors
                        are friendly and very happy to help any members with their 
                        problems. Registering is simple and easy, and it doesn't require
                        any credit card information. Sweet Homes looks forward to your
                        usage of our services.
